SpaCy Blank NER Model on HomeDepot Kaggle Data Set
Introduction
Welcome to the SpaCy Blank NER Model project! This project focuses on developing a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using SpaCy. 
The primary goal is to identify entities belonging to the following categories: PERCENTAGE, MATERIAL, FEATURE, PRODUCT, SIZE, LIVING_BEING, TEMPERATURE, COLOR, SHAPE, ORG, and AREA.

Data set created by https://github.com/tecoholic/ner-annotator

Features
Entity Categories: The model is trained to recognize entities in the specified categories, providing a detailed and comprehensive identification of various types of information.
Flexibility: The blank SpaCy model serves as a starting point, allowing for customization and fine-tuning to adapt to specific requirements or domains.
Scalability: The model can be further trained on additional data to improve accuracy and expand its entity recognition capabilities.
